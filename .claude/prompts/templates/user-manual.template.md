## Content Rules (remove this section from generated docs)

### How to extract UI details from code:
1. **Button labels** — from ERB view templates (`app/views/`), look for `link_to`, `button_to`, `submit_tag` text
2. **Menu/navigation paths** — from layout files and sidebar partials
3. **Form fields** — from `_form.html.erb` partials, look for `f.input`, `f.text_field`, label text
4. **Flash messages** — from controller actions, look for `flash[:notice]`, `flash[:alert]`
5. **Tab names** — from view templates, look for tab/nav components
6. **Permission names** — from Pundit policies, translate method names to plain language
   (e.g., `manage_assignments?` → "Manage Assignments permission")
7. **Status/state labels** — from AASM states, but use the display name not the code symbol

### What to NEVER include:
- Code snippets of any kind
- Database details
- File paths or class names
- Technical architecture
- Internal implementation details

### Style guidelines:
- Use **bold** for UI element names (buttons, menu items, field labels, tab names)
- Use exact labels as they appear in the UI (extracted from ERB templates)
- Write in second person ("You", "Your")
- Keep steps atomic — one action per step
- Include "Expected Result" after each task section
